    "\n",
    "Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of Artificial Intelligence that enables computers to **learn patterns from data** and make decisions or predictions **without being explicitly programmed with rules**.\n",

    "Instead of writing step-by-step instructions, we give the machine:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data (X)**\n",
    "- **Correct answers (y)** → only in supervised learning\n",
    "- **An algorithm** that learns the relationship\n",
